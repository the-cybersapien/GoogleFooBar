# Google Foobar Challenge

Google Foobar challenge is a "secret" hiring challenge by google, which sometimes show up while people search for elements related to `Java` or `Python` programming.

This repository contains my code for the Foobar Challenge.
There are 5 total levels, with increasing difficulty and different number of questions at each level.


## [LEVEL 1](/Level1)
Contains 1 question of easy difficulty, with a time limit of 48 hours. Open the Level1 folder for details.
#### Journal Entry
> Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

> Why did you sign up for infiltration duty again? The pamphlets from Bunny HQ promised exotic and interesting missions, yet here you are drudging in the lowest level of Commander Lambda's organization. Hopefully you get that promotion soon...

## [LEVEL 2](/Level2)
Contains 2 question of easy to medium difficulty, with a time limit of 72 hours. Open the Level2 folder for details.
#### Journal Entry
> You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to
take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

> The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure
it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

> The perks are definitely better as a Henchman than as a Minion. You're even allowed to sleep lying down!

## [LEVEL 3](/Level3)
Contains 3 question of medium difficulty, with a time limit of 96 hours. Open the Level3 folder for details.
#### Journal Entry
> Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you
her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which
means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP
doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your
new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

> For a world-destroying despot with a penchant for making space-station-sized
doomsday devices, Commander Lambda sure has good taste in office furniture. As her
personal assistant, you have the latest in standing desk and ergonomic chair
technology, and it sure makes a difference!

> One of these days you're going to manage to glimpse Commander Lambda's
password over her shoulder. But she's very careful about security, and you
haven't managed it yet...

> Who the heck puts clover and coffee creamer in their tea? Commander Lambda,
apparently. When you signed up to infiltrate her organization, you didn't think
you'd get such an up-close and personal look at her more...unusual tastes.

## [LEVEL 4](/Level4)
Contains 2 questions of hard difficulty, with a time limit of 360 hours (I know!). Open the Level4 folder for details.
#### Journal Entry
> Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved
Bunny Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important
part of her space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction
that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and
escape before the entire thing explodes?

> This was supposed to be an infiltration-and-rescue mission, not a repeat of the
Great Cowland Station fiasco! You didn't think rescuing bunnies would involve
this much running.

> Not all of the bunny prisoners are highly-trained operatives. Some of them are
civilians, and they're panicking in all the noise and confusion of the space
station's destruction. Several of them have wedged themselves into corners and
started thumping, which isn't exactly helping the station's structural
integrity...
